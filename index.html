    <h1>SoundAmplifier Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: March 29, 2025</strong></p>
    
    <p>We at [Your Company/Developer Name] are committed to protecting your privacy while you use the <strong>SoundAmplifier</strong> application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information. Please read it carefully to understand our practices.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>SoundAmplifier is an audio amplification app that utilizes your device’s microphone. Below are the types of information we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Audio Data:</strong> The app uses your device’s microphone to capture environmental audio when you enable the amplification or recording features. This audio data is processed in real-time for amplification or recording purposes and is not transmitted off your device unless you actively share a recording.</li>
        <li><strong>Recordings:</strong> When you use the recording feature, audio files are saved locally on your device as .m4a files in the app’s Documents directory.</li>
        <li><strong>User Settings:</strong> We store your preferences (such as volume level, EQ frequency, EQ gain, language, and voice filter status) locally on your device using UserDefaults to maintain a personalized experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Permissions:</strong> The app requires access to your microphone and storage to function. We do not collect data from sources beyond what is necessary for the app’s functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide real-time audio amplification through your microphone.</li>
        <li>Record and store audio files upon your request.</li>
        <li>Customize your user experience based on your selected settings (e.g., volume, EQ, language).</li>
        <li>Ensure the app operates smoothly on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We <strong>do not</strong> use your data for advertising, analytics, or any purpose other than supporting SoundAmplifier’s features.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All audio data, recordings, and settings are stored locally on your device. We do not store data on remote servers or in the cloud.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Data is stored in the app’s Documents directory and is only accessible through SoundAmplifier. However, you are responsible for securing your device against unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You can delete recordings at any time through the “Recordings” interface in the app. Uninstalling the app will remove all local data (including recordings and settings) from your device, unless you have backed them up elsewhere.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Sharing Information</h2>
    <p>We <strong>do not share</strong> any data collected from you with third parties, except in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You manually share a recording with others via external apps or services (e.g., email, messaging).</li>
        <li>We are legally required to disclose information (if applicable).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Microphone and Audio Access</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>SoundAmplifier requires microphone access to amplify audio and record. This permission is requested when you first launch the app.</li>
        <li>The app uses AVAudioSession to configure an audio session in play-and-record mode, allowing simultaneous recording and playback through speakers or headphones.</li>
        <li>We do not record or store audio without your explicit consent (via the “Record” button).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have full control over your data in SoundAmplifier:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>View, play, or delete recordings at any time in the “Recordings” section.</li>
        <li>Adjust or reset settings in the “Settings” section.</li>
        <li>Deny microphone access (though this will limit the app’s functionality).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children</h2>
    <p>SoundAmplifier is not specifically designed for children under 13 years of age. We do not intentionally collect data from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided data to us, please contact us to assist in removing it.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. The latest version will be available in the app or on our website (if applicable).</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:[Your Email Address]">[Your Email Address]</a> or through the contact information provided in the app store.</p>

    <div class="footer">
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> This policy assumes the app does not connect to the internet or share data externally. If additional features (e.g., server uploads, ads, or analytics) are added, this policy will need to be updated accordingly.</p>
